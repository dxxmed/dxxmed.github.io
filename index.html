Hey! I am dxxmed! On Roblox I'm known as Doomcolp or D00M3D. This is my game portfolio for future reference. In my portfolio, I have my personal games / projects. I'm also gonna feature plugins soon; well once I start making em.

The most popular game I've made is "Roblox Studio" (a recreation of the actual Roblox Studio). I have about 2 other games I'm also working on.

I figured that the Roblox Talent Hub wasn't good enough. I wanted to show all the projects I'd made. So, I decided to create this website. I made this with some basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript (could've been PHP but I prefer HTML).

I made this game in about early January 2023. I came up with the idea randomly and looked to see if anyone else had made it yet. Not really. There had been other games who recreated Roblox Studio; but they didn't really have the same feel. I saw a game called "RetroStudio" which is basically a game that simulates a 2009 - 2015 type Roblox Studio (and you can make your own retro games too). This really inspired me to continue with my [very generic] idea. It went thru / through many stages of development. Now I'm not saying it's perfect right now; however, I'm really proud of it since I'm doing this by myself.

This is an edited screenshot of the game's built-in IDE/Script Editor. I added some highlights in Photoshop (and messed up a bit lol), but yeah it has a syntax highlighter, block completer, and more! For the lexer (lexical analyzer) I'm using for syntax highlighting, it's really bad, like <b>really bad</b>; the organization in my lexer is terrible. The game needs a bit more work, but so far it's going good (and this is just covering the "studio part", there's a main game and a testing place).

Above this description is a screenshot of the "experience creator". It's based off of the official Roblox Creator Dashboard (<a href="https://create.roblox.com">Link</a>). I'll scale the UI and make it look more like the real thing in the future. But for now, I'ma leave it like that.
